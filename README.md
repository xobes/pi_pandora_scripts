I have my raspberry pi in the livingroom set up to play pandora via pianobar with patiobar as a frontend.

I'd previoulsy mucked around with pulse audio so that that Pi was recieving audio from another who in turn got it's audio via bluetooth from  my phone... the sound quality never lined up with what I had hoped for.

These scripts address issues with using pulseaudio (disabled by stop_pulseaudio.sh from within run_pianobar.sh) and later re-enable it, though why I don't know, I'll never use it.

Now deleting the state file on startup cause volume can go negative with used of repeated ( or )

$ cat ~/.config/pianobar/state
